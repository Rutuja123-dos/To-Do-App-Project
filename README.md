## 📝 To-Do App
A robust Command-Line Interface (CLI) application built to manage daily tasks efficiently. This project demonstrates core programming concepts like list manipulation, infinite loops, and conditional logic in Python.

🚀 Features
Batch Initialization: Allows users to input a set number of tasks at the start.

CRUD Functionality: * Create: Add new tasks dynamically.

Read: View the entire list of tasks at any time.

Update: Search for an existing task and replace it with new text.

Delete: Remove specific tasks from the list using their names.

Interactive Menu: A user-friendly numerical menu to navigate between different operations.

Graceful Exit: Option to safely close the application.

🛠️ Concepts Applied
Functions: Encapsulated logic within the task() function.

Data Structures: Utilized Python Lists for dynamic data storage.

Looping: Implemented while True for a continuous user experience.

Indexing: Used .index() to find and modify specific elements in the task list.

📋 How to Run
Ensure you have Python installed.

Copy the code into a file named todo_app.py.

Run the script via terminal:

Bash
python todo_app.py
🧠 Future Enhancements
Implement File Handling to save tasks to a .txt or .json file so they persist after closing the app.

Add a GUI version using Tkinter.

Include Timestamps for when tasks are added.
